       <div> <h3>Universal Orlando Resort</h3> <br><br>
        <p>When one theme park just isn't enough, stay at the resort that has three. Fancy a plunge down a 125ft
             drop water slide? Grab your swimsuits for Universal's Volcano Bay water theme park. Then, immerse yourself
              in the next generation of blockbuster entertainment at Universal Studios Florida before journeying
               through legendary worlds of incredible heroes at Universal' Islands of Adventure. Whatever your
                accommodation needs are, eight hotel options range from premium glitz at the Hard Rock Hotel®, to
                 fresh and fun value at Universal's Endless Summer Resort. <br> <br>
            
            360 Travels offers seven nights at the 3* Universal's Endless Summer Resort - Dockside Inn
             and Suites and Universal's Endless Summer Resort - Surfside Inn and Suites from £679pp, travelling on
              selected dates from 1-31 January 2024 inclusive. Includes economy (World Traveller) return flights from

        <p>This is just the spot for comfortable, cheerful accommodation and great value for money. The Ramada Plaza
             Resort enjoys an excellent location on Orlando's famous International Drive and the hotel provides a free
              daily shuttle service to the city's main attractions. A complimentary continental breakfast is on offer,
               so the whole family can fuel up on cereal, fruit and waffles before a big day of adventuring. There are
                many more restaurants within walking distance, too, as well as shops galore at Pointe Orlando and The
                 Florida Mall. Our top tip is to book a club-level suite for exclusive access to the rooftop pool, bar
                  and sundeck. Plus, drinks are unlimited on the club level from 12pm to 8pm every day.<br> <br>
            
            360 Travels offers seven nights for the price of five on flight and hotel package bookings.
             Valid for travel until the end of January 2024. Book by 31 March 2023. The specified offer will appear

        <p> The Rosen Shingle Creek brings five-star elegance to Orlando's Universal Boulevard. As well as your proximity
             to the city's many theme parks, you'll find plenty of diversions at home, with four pools and a spa available
              for adults who need to unwind (the Himalayan salt stone massage should do the trick). Plus, golfers will be
               enamoured with the Shingle Creek Golf Club's award-winning course, expertly designed to be both challenging
                and entertaining. Dining options abound, too, from a morning coffee and pastry at Smooth Java, to the AAA
                 Four Diamond Italian bistro, Cala Bella. If you do visit the latter, we recommend the superb rock lobster
                  cacio e pepe. <br> <br>
            
            360 Travels offers free breakfast for two people for stays from 1-31 August and 1-23 December.

        <p>The Waldorf Astoria name assures sophisticated luxury, and this Florida location does not disappoint. All
             five-star rooms and suites deliver plush furnishings, stylish warm décor and Italian marble bathrooms.
              Your gastronomic choices here are bountiful, but treating yourself to a filet mignon at the lauded Bull
               & Bear steakhouse is a decision you won't regret. While away your days in a private cabana by one of two
                spacious pools or practise your long game on the resort's 18-hole golf course. If you have little ones
                 to entertain, daily poolside lawn games and scavenger hunts will help. You won't need to go far for
                  theme park frivolity, either, as Walt Disney World borders the hotel on three sides. <br> <br>
            
            360 Travels offers a $100 resort credit per room per minimum seven-night stay. Guests get
             free shuttles to the Disney parks plus early access. Valid for arrivals from 14 April to 14 October 2023.

      <div>  <h3>Caribe Royale Orlando </h3><br><br>
        <p>Swaying palms adorn the grounds of this impressive contemporary resort. Ideal for those who love an active
             holiday, the Caribe Royale Orlando has a two-storey fitness centre, tennis courts, basketball courts and
              a 1.5-mile walking and running trail. All that activity should be rewarded and a cocktail at the Rum bar
               is the way to do it - we'd go for a Rum Negroni 16 with Black Tot, sweet vermouth and vanilla, along with
                some Cuban-style tapas. Weekend nights are particularly special here, with poolside 'Movies under the
                 Stars' screenings of family-friendly films. Naturally, Orlando's theme parks are an easy distance away
                  by shuttle or car. <br> <br>
            
            360 Travels offers up to 35 per cent off hotel stays of five nights or more. Valid for travel

        <p>Located in the Disney Springs Resort area, the Drury Plaza Hotel Orlando boasts mesmerising views of Lake Buena
             Vista. Florida's trademark sun means temperatures can get high, but cooling off is a breeze with a saltwater
              pool, whirlpool and splash pad at your disposal. Take advantage of the complimentary shuttle service to
               spend joyful days at Disney's Magic Kingdom Park, Hollywood Studios and EPCOT. This is an official Walt
                Disney World hotel, so you'll benefit from early entrance when you get there. Breakfast is also free,
                 but familiar favourites Starbucks and Pizza Hut Express are at the ready to provide extra sustenance.
                  Oh, and there's also the 5:30 Kickback, where guests can enjoy a rotating menu of complimentary drinks
                   and hot snacks every night between 5.30-7.30pm (up to three alcoholic or non-alcoholic drinks).<br> <br>

             with 14 slides and rides, plus a 6,500sqft arcade. While the kids are having a whale of a time, you can take
              it easy at the Wet Rooster Tiki Bar with a well-earned cocktail. Dining options are simple and
               family-friendly here, with a hot buffet breakfast at Tradewinds restaurant and burgers, pizzas and more at
                the Callaloo Grill. The guest rooms are cosy, light and outfitted with a 55in flatscreen TV - great for
                 chilling out after a busy day. Situated on International Drive, this hotel is the perfect base from which
                  to enjoy the city. <br> <br>

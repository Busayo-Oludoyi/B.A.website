        <br>
    <P>You might associate the Japanese capital with cutting-edge
         tech, but the city also has a fascinating spiritual
          heritage. Learn about its unique blend of Zen Buddhism
           and Shintoism on a tour of the best shrines and temples
            in Tokyo <br><br> <br> 28/02/2023</P>

     <p class="para">When visiting a country that's so famous for its
         secular exports such as sushi, manga and
          electronics, you might be surprised by how much
           religion is on display, even in a hyper-modern
            metropolis like Tokyo. The city is filled with
             dozens, if not hundreds, of temples and
              shrines, practically on every street corner.
            <br><br>
                These ornate buildings give insight into Japan's
                 special blend of spirituality, which has been
                  shaped by two different but complementary
                   religious traditions. The first is Japan's
                    homegrown strand of animism, called Shintoism.
                     Its temples, known as jinja (shrines), can be
                      identified by torii gates - simple archways
                       that denote the separation of the mundane
                        from the sacred, often painted in a vibrant
                         shiny red.</p>

    <div class="writeup">
         <p class="para">The other main religion is Buddhism: various sects, including Zen,
                         were imported from India and China in the 6th century.
                          Buddhist temples also have gates (sanmon), but these tend to
                           be far more impressive, multi-storey affairs, accompanied by
                            ornate towers or pagodas.
                                <br><br>
                        These two religions are practised both separately and together
                         in a mixture of traditions known as shinbutsu-shūgō. No visit
                          to Japan is complete without exploring how these two religions
                           have shaped the country's culture and history - from Samurai
                            warriors to Japanese garden design. Take a trip around some
                             of Tokyo's must-see temples and shrines to immerse yourself
                              in Japanese spirituality.

                                <br> <br> You won't struggle to find the Zōjō-ji, right beneath
                                 the iconic Tokyo Tower in Shiba Park. Dating back to
                                  the 1390s as the main temple of Jōdo Buddhism, it was
                                   rebuilt after World War II bombings.

                                Look out for the poignant Garden for Unborn Children,
                                 where offerings are dedicated to the growth and health
                                  of children, and are left to Jizō Bosatsu, the Buddhist
                                   protector of women and children.

        <p class="para">If you'd like to take part in some Zen meditation yourself, head to the Kōrin-in sub-temple,
          a couple of train stops from Shibuya, where several zazen meditation sessions are offered
            every weekday at 7am. Beginners are welcome to join, and explanations are in Japanese
             and English.</p>

        <p class="topic"> <strong><i>Atago Jinja was built on top of a hill to protect its wooden structure from fire,
                         and a visit is not for the faint hearted</i></strong></p>
              <br>    <hr>   <br>
         <p class="topic_text">Also in the central areas you'll find the rustic Shinto shrine, Atago Jinja. It was built
                on top of a hill to protect its wooden structure from fire, and a visit is not for the faint
                    hearted. You must climb up a steep flight of 86 stairs - dubbed the 'stone steps to success' - to
                        access its delights.

                Visit the central-west area of Shibuya for the city's most impressive Shinto shrine: Meiji Jingu.
                 The word 'Jingu' indicates an Imperial connection, and this shrine is dedicated to Emperor Meiji,
                   Japan's first constitutional monarch, who died in 1912, and his wife, Empress Shoken. It's a
                      popular place for traditional Japanese-style weddings, as you will no doubt see on your visit,
                        and it's also known as an urban woodland oasis, surrounded by some 36,000 trees.
                        
                Don't miss Senso-ji, the city's oldest Buddhist temple, built when its home in Asakusa was a
                 separate town, rather than part of the urban sprawl. Today it's known for its riverside locations
                    and local crafts - as well as for its temple, which draws 30 million worshippers per year.</p>

                         For a truly unusual take on religion, take the train south to Tamagawa Station for the Tamagawa
                            Sengen Shrine, where visitors worship Godzilla. Although the shrine dates back to the 1180s
                           and has some unique architecture in the Sengen-zukuri style, its main draw today is as a
                            filming location for the 2016 movie, Shin Godzilla, and visitors can buy religious objects
                             bearing the lizard's image.</p>

                <p class="para">Finally, and particularly if you find yourself in Tokyo this May, you must go to the Kanda
                    Myojin Shrine - home to Shinto worship for 1,300 years. The Kanda Matsuri (or Kanda Festival)
                     held here biannually is one of the three most important Shinto festivals in Japan - involving
                      200 mikoshi (portable shrines), as well as floats, musicians and dancers.

                     Even visiting just half of these temples will give you a fantastic overview of the spiritual
                      culture of Japan. After a hard few days of sightseeing, put your feet up at your hotel
                         - we recommend staying in the Shibuya, Asakusa and Shiba areas, which are close to several
                            of the central temples. Breathe out and relax.</p>

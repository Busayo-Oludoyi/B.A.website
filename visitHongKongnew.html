            <P>You might associate the Japanese capital with cutting-edge tech, but the city
            also has a fascinating spiritual heritage. Learn about its unique blend of
            Zen Buddhismand Shintoism on a tour of the best shrines and temples in Tokyo</P> 
                    <p class="date">28/02/2023</P>

           <div class="writeup_2">  <p class="para">When visiting a country that's so famous for its
                 secular exports such as sushi, manga and
                  electronics, you might be surprised by how much
                   religion is on display, even in a hyper-modern
                    metropolis like Tokyo. The city is filled with
                     dozens, if not hundreds, of temples and
                      shrines, practically on every street corner.</p>
                   
                        <p>These ornate buildings give insight into Japan's
                         special blend of spirituality, which has been
                          shaped by two different but complementary
                           religious traditions. The first is Japan's
                            homegrown strand of animism, called Shintoism.
                             Its temples, known as jinja (shrines), can be
                              identified by torii gates - simple archways
                               that denote the separation of the mundane
                                from the sacred, often painted in a vibrant
                                 shiny red.</p>
                                </div>     
                                
         <figure class="one">
           <div class="hk_1"> <img class="firstpic" src="img/tokyo-01-zojo-ji.jpeg" alt="tokyo_zojo"> </div>

         </figure>         

         <div class="writeup_3">
            <p class="para">The other main religion is Buddhism: various sects, including Zen,
                            were imported from India and China in the 6th century.
                             Buddhist temples also have gates (sanmon), but these tend to
                              be far more impressive, multi-storey affairs, accompanied by
                               ornate towers or pagodas.</p>
                                   
                          <p>These two religions are practised both separately and together
                            in a mixture of traditions known as shinbutsu-shūgō. No visit
                             to Japan is complete without exploring how these two religions
                              have shaped the country's culture and history - from Samurai
                               warriors to Japanese garden design. Take a trip around some
                                of Tokyo's must-see temples and shrines to immerse yourself
                                 in Japanese spirituality.</p>

                                   <p> You won't struggle to find the Zōjō-ji, right beneath
                                    the iconic Tokyo Tower in Shiba Park. Dating back to
                                     the 1390s as the main temple of Jōdo Buddhism, it was
                                      rebuilt after World War II bombings.</p>
                                    
                                  <p> Look out for the poignant Garden for Unborn Children,
                                    where offerings are dedicated to the growth and health
                                     of children, and are left to Jizō Bosatsu, the Buddhist
                                      protector of women and children.</p>

            <p class="para">If you'd like to take part in some Zen meditation yourself, head to the Kōrin-in sub-temple,
              a couple of train stops from Shibuya, where several zazen meditation sessions are offered
                every weekday at 7am. Beginners are welcome to join, and explanations are in Japanese
                 and English.</p></div>

                   <hr>   
             <div class="writeup_6"><p class="topic_text">Also in the central areas you'll find the rustic Shinto shrine, Atago Jinja. It was built
                    on top of a hill to protect its wooden structure from fire, and a visit is not for the faint
                        hearted. You must climb up a steep flight of 86 stairs - dubbed the 'stone steps to success' - to
                            access its delights.</p>
    
                 <p> Visit the central-west area of Shibuya for the city's most impressive Shinto shrine: Meiji Jingu.
                     The word 'Jingu' indicates an Imperial connection, and this shrine is dedicated to Emperor Meiji,
                       Japan's first constitutional monarch, who died in 1912, and his wife, Empress Shoken. It's a
                          popular place for traditional Japanese-style weddings, as you will no doubt see on your visit,
                            and it's also known as an urban woodland oasis, surrounded by some 36,000 trees.</p>
                            
                    <p>Don't miss Senso-ji, the city's oldest Buddhist temple, built when its home in Asakusa was a
                     separate town, rather than part of the urban sprawl. Today it's known for its riverside locations
                        and local crafts - as well as for its temple, which draws 30 million worshippers per year.</p>

            <p class="para">Suburban highlights: giant mythological reptiles</p>
                <p> For a truly unusual take on religion, take the train south to Tamagawa Station for the Tamagawa
                    Sengen Shrine, where visitors worship Godzilla. Although the shrine dates back to the 1180s
                   and has some unique architecture in the Sengen-zukuri style, its main draw today is as a
                    filming location for the 2016 movie, Shin Godzilla, and visitors can buy religious objects
                     bearing the lizard's image.</p>

           <div class="writeup_8">
            <p class="para">Finally, and particularly if you find yourself in Tokyo this May, you must go to the Kanda
                Myojin Shrine - home to Shinto worship for 1,300 years. The Kanda Matsuri (or Kanda Festival)
                 held here biannually is one of the three most important Shinto festivals in Japan - involving
                  200 mikoshi (portable shrines), as well as floats, musicians and dancers.</p>

                 <p>Even visiting just half of these temples will give you a fantastic overview of the spiritual
                  culture of Japan. After a hard few days of sightseeing, put your feet up at your hotel
                     - we recommend staying in the Shibuya, Asakusa and Shiba areas, which are close to several
                        of the central temples. Breathe out and relax.</p>

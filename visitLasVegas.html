            <p>We take a road trip to the ghost towns and vast desert highways of Death Valley, which provide
                 a welcome, low-octane counterpart to the city's neon hedonism</p>

            <article class="two">
                <p>Clapping eyes on our lavish hotel rooms, 28 floors high in The Bellagio, it's obvious that
                     any resistance to Sin City is futile. Our windows look out on to Vegas's most famous sites:
                      the resort's 1,000ft dancing fountain, the world's biggest Ferris wheel, a mini sparkling
                       Eiffel Tower and an Egyptian pyramid with a laser shooting from it (naturally).</p> 

                   <p> We're not here for Las Vegas decadence - but just for one night, we'll dip our toes in. It
                     doesn't get more quintessentially Vegas than sitting in a VIP suite at O by Cirque du Soleil,
                      sipping Champagne and eating chocolate-covered strawberries as acrobats launch themselves on
                       to a stage filled with 1.5 million gallons of water, and a chap lights himself on fire for
                        almost five minutes. We have a fashionably late meal at the Art Deco Mayfair Supper Club,
                         where sequinned dancers perform salacious routines and patrons tuck into 
                         bigger-than-their-heads lobster Thermidor and aged tomahawk steaks.</p>
                    
                   <p> Since our arrival, we've barely experienced fresh air. But, from tomorrow, we're about
                     to get a whole load of it - we're filling up the car and heading for Nevada's epic empty
                      roads, grand scenery and geological masterpieces. Buckle up and come along for the ride.</p>

                <h1>Morning</h1> <br><br>
                <p>The neon glow of the city soon morphs into still, wide-open spaces as we drive west out of
                     Vegas along Route 160. Just 20 miles from the Strip, imposing mountains soar into view.
                      One of the best places to be introduced to these expansive desert scenes is at Sanders
                       Family Winery, in the shadow of the Spring Mountains to the East, and the colourful
                        Nopah Range to the West. It's Nevada's first winery, built in 1988 in Tuscan style.
                         The tasting room looks straight out of Italy, complete with vine-draped grounds,
                          turrets and a bell tower.
                    <br><br>
                    “Most people don't realise that the best wines in the world are from dry climates,” says
                     founder Jack Sanders, as we sip a sweet white wine. “This is an agricultural valley, so we
                      can grow just about any kind of wine.” His success has inspired others in the area to take
                       up the challenge. Pahrump's Artesian Cellars opened just before the pandemic and sells a
                        popular Chardonnay and Zinfandel (plus watermelon and mango Moscato slushies) in a buzzing,
                         intimate tasting room.</p>

                <h1>Afternoon</h1>
                    <p>On the road out of the medium-sized town of Pahrump, we spot a classic American institution
                     in full swing - a local Saturday Swap Meet, packed with dozens of stalls, desert crafts and
                      friendly locals. Chad Phillips creates pieces of art and jewellery from reclaimed wood,
                       iron and deer antlers.</p>

                        while we peruse Carol Sparacino's stall of reclaimed goods, she offers us a shot of cinnamon whiskey
                         - “a Swap Meet tradition,” she insists. It's only 45 minutes out of Vegas, but it feels a million miles
                          from the Strip's anonymity.</p>

                <p>Our next destination is set to truly turn down the tempo of Vegas. Ash Meadows National Wildlife Refuge is the
                     deserted ancestral land of the Nuwuvi peoples. This sleepy, unique wetland is home to rare wildlife,
                      including five endangered species. It's a silent place to decompress from the city, with boardwalks
                       snaking around protected habitats, and benches to watch for pigmy blue butterflies, black-tailed
                        jackrabbits and gopher snakes. We peer into the waterways and spot a rare, electric-blue pupfish
                         flitting below the surface. </p>

                    <p>As dusk nears, the sun dips below Pyramid Peak and California's Sierra Nevada to the west, setting
                         it ablaze in pink light. Miles from the light pollution of Vegas, blackness draws in. The wilds of
                          Nevada are home to the darkest skies in the Lower 48, an astral blanket stretching to infinity above.
                           Our abode for the night is only four miles away and as close as you can get to the California border.
                            Longstreet Inn and Casino, in the Amargosa Valley, is lost in time, scattered with antiques such as
                             a 1960s barber chair, vintage typewriter, stuffed bison head and the original hat owned by gold mining
                              con man Walter Edward Perry Scott.

           <p>Retro Jack's Cafe serves suitably hearty biscuits, gravy, and fried steak to folks like us going on to Death
                 Valley National Park, 25 miles away. Bellies full, we enter the park from the winding southeast along Route
                  190, stopping at Zabriskie Point's hilly badlands. “The nearby hike from Golden Canyon up to Manly Beacon
                   is our favourite in the park,” say California walkers Grace and Bill, as we snap photos of the maze of
                    canyons and spectacular sandstone pleated hillsides, formed over thousands of years as a result of flash
                     storms.
                
                Further along the park's main artery (Route 190) is Badwater Road, home to Badwater Basin - the lowest
                 elevation in North America, sitting at a staggering 282ft below sea level. The ground crunches underfoot
                  as we wander the beguiling 200-square-mile salt pan, which is seemingly devoid of life. The hottest
                   temperature on earth was recorded only 20 miles away at Furnace Creek, clocking in at 57°C - hot enough
                    to fry an egg on the pavement (although park officials have asked tourists to stop attempting it). On
                     our visit (in late January), it's a warm 23°C as the sun reflects off the wedding-cake-white land.</p>

                     another continent - with dramatic heaps of sand rising 100ft like those in the Sahara. A five-minute drive
                      north is a geologist's dream. Mosaic Canyon has smooth slot canyons, swirling rock formations, irregular
                       shapes, compacted shards and dolomites transformed into marble by heat and pressure. On Route 374, the
                        road snakes through arid mountainscapes before reaching the Death Valley National Park sign and a
                         perfectly straight road sliced into the landscape, with views stretching as far as the eye can see
                          over shrub-dotted desert. Cue Born to Be Wild.</p>

                     temperatures have dropped by almost 20°C. This boom-and-bust town was home to thousands of
                      gold prospectors at the beginning of the 20th century. There were 50 saloons here in its
                       heyday, which was short-lived. All that's left now are the eerie carcasses of a train
                        depot, a casino and the shell of the Cook Bank - a once-opulent structure with a marble
                         staircase and mahogany details. The Goldwell Open Air Museum gives the setting a new
                          purpose, with sculptures including Ghost Rider - Alber Szukalski's depiction of a

                      “They love dog biscuits and carrots,” local Patti Butler tells us at Happy Burro Chili & Beer, a rickety
                       wooden saloon serving award-winning chili among historical photos and memorabilia. This teeny town of
                        1,000 people still has plenty of disseminated gold, but now it's a base camp for Death Valley visitors.
                         The spaceship-like Atomic Inn pays homage to nearby Area 51 (America's most famous top-secret military

                <p>The real treasure of El Dorado City is the mines below ground. Three miles of tunnels were
                     hand-carved here by miners, who made their prospectors millions of dollars of gold and
                      silver between 1861 to 1964, until the mines were flooded. We descend into a section of
                       tunnels, dropping 500ft in places, to get a harrowing glimpse into the perilous job of

                     to join it again just yet.</p>
